# SWdevEX
This project is a part of software development course. I hope to help my juniors 3rd understand about web application, web service and socket io. I create a example code by using Nodejs and another packages (you can see in pakage.json).

# Installation
Most projects i used to develop on UNIX. But, In this installation. I try to write installation base on Windows. However, Between Windows & UNIX has only Nodejs installation differently.

## on Windows
