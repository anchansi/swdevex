# SWdevEX
This project is a part of software development course. I hope to help my juniors 3rd understand about web application, web service and socket io. I create a example code by using Nodejs and another packages (you can see in pakage.json).

# Installation
Most projects i used to develop on Linux. But, In this installation. I try to write installation base on Windows. However, Between Windows & Linux has only Nodejs installation differently. You can still use another basic installation commands to both OS.

## Nodejs & npm

### on Windows
follow this link. it'll redirect you to go to Nodejs homepage. Download Nodejs package and install it by "Next Installation" (joke!) on your Windows.
* Nodejs Home page : https://nodejs.org

### on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)
follow this commands. On linux, Nodejs doesn't provide npm package when frist installstion like Windows. You must install npm package bt your self. I recommend to use stable version from default repositories.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
```
